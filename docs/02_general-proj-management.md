# General project management

## Definitions

What are we talking about when we talk about project management?

    -  *Project management*: Organizing people, tasks, and timelines in the pursuit of goals. This is probably what you think about when you hear the phrase \"project management\"
    -  *Data management*: Gathering data, cleaning and verifying data, making backups and archives. Most researchers have some experience with this. Requires an organizational system and workflow, so somewhat analogous to software project management.
    -  *Software project management*: Managing the development of software. This means managing the project (see 1), but also managing the *development*. This means managing a group of people who are trying to write (correct, pertinent) code, and making informed choices about language, tools, and work flows that support writing that code.

## Identification

What kind of project do you have? Things to consider:

    -   *Small vs. large* (the practices still work if it\'s just you, but you have more flexibility)
    -   *Existing constraints*: Required language, packages, computing environment
    -   *Control*: How much of a driver\'s seat do you have?

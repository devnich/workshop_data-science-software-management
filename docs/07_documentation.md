# Documentation

## Documentation should describe what you actually do

Contextualize all the things!

1.  Why did you make this decision?
2.  How does this work?

## Documentation workflow

You want an easy-to-use collaborative workflow. Here are some options (not mutually exclusive):

1.  Explanatory code comments
2.  README files (Github will render Markdown README files as nice web pages)
3.  Github wiki
4.  Many other wikis
5.  Word documents in Dropbox, I guess? Sometimes you have to make compromises.

For more project documentation tips including for writing a useful readME and metadata, see the workshops and tutorials under [Additional Resources](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_data-science-software-management/additional-resources.html).

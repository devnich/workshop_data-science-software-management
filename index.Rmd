# Overview {-}

![](`r url14`)

Creating a repeatable process for developing your software is an important component of reproducible research. This workshop discusses how and why we build code, possible development workflows, project management strategies, and tool selection. This workshop is designed for learners who are writing and applying code for their research projects, but have no or limited formal computer science training. After this workshop, learners should be able to describe the basic process of developing code, compare the benefits of different tools and coding workflows based on project goals and constraints, and identify appropriate strategies for managing and archiving project artifacts (including code and data). There are no specific prerequisites for this lecture/discussion-focused workshop, but it is designed for learners with prior coding experience.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
